Dear Codeowners
You are addressed in this PR because you are listed as maintainers for at least one of samples in sdk-nrf/samples/.
I've sent an email before (23.04) titled "CI testing scope for NCS samples" where I asked for your action to add integration_platforms to sample yaml. Below I copy that message. Please do the needed changes ASAP. This is crucial to make your sample building in our CI.
Cheers,
Maciej

Dear NCS,
We want to increase the transparency of the testing scope in the CI, starting with tests at sdk-nrf/samples (only downstream samples for now).
Why:
•	a relation between which platform will be tested for what sample is not clear for developers. Mutually exclusive filters are used during the process resulting in platforms not being tested.
•	a reliable source of the testing scope is required for the documentation purpose and customer support.
How the scope will be defined:
•	The platform scope for on-commit CI tests will be defined at a sample level, set by an entry "integration_platforms" in sample.yaml (e.g. https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/blob/master/samples/subsys/usb/dfu/sample.yaml)
•	Having a platform in sample's "integration_platforms" list will guarantee that the sample will be built on this platform and won't be silently skipped
•	A nightly CI plan will be building every sample/test for every nrf platform fulfilling conditions defined in test's/sample's yaml file 
If you are a CODEOWNER of a sample (https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/blob/master/CODEOWNERS for /samples/), you need to do these 2 things:
•	add "integration_platforms" list to every sample you maintain at https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf/tree/master/samples
•	probably you can copy platforms from "platform_allow" list (note a different format of these two list, all entries in integration_platforms has to start with "-" like in the above example).
•	please consider removing "platform_allow". This list works only as a filter blocking testing on anything outside this list (will affect the nightly plan). If possible, replace it with platform’s features the sample depends on (like in the above example).
Please provide the requested changes by the end of this month.
This page Sample.yaml vs compatible boards will provide you with some more details about the process and its background.
Similar approach will also be taken for /tests/ and /applications/ (basically for everything what is tested with Twister)

If you have comments or questions, please state them at Sample.yaml vs compatible boards.
Best regards,
